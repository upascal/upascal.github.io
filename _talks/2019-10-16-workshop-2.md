A series of talks and workshops centered around machine learning, abstraction, and algorithmic subjectivity. Exploring the interconnection between art and machine learning. Participants will learn how certain ML models work, play with them in creative/critical ways, and contextualize them to make better sense of an algorithmic paradigm. We will kick off the weekend in downtown LA with an evening panel discussion and social, followed by 1.5 days of workshops at UCLA's campus in Westwood. This event was made possible thanks to a grant by the ICCA Interdisciplinary Symposia/Workshop Award.
