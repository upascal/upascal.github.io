I am a PhD Candidate in the department of Information Studies at UCLA. My research focuses on the globalization of financial information infrastructures. For my dissertation, “Circuits of Finance: NASDAQ and the making of a global market” I have been investigating NASDAQ’s role as a global supplier of stock exchange infrastructures to financial centers around the world. Using the attempt to build a 24/7 computerized market network between NASDAQ and sister exchanges in Singapore and London as a case, my research asks how information technologies, protocols, and metadata schema condition the mobility of market logics.
