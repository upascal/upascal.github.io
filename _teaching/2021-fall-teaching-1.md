This course is a cross-disciplinary exploration of the social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, and structural aspects of information and media technologies. We touch on issues in the study of digital media, librarianship, communications, computer science, sociology, digital humanities, political science, and anthropology in this class. It satisfies an undergraduate General Education requirement, and serves as a survey of important interdisciplinary material that constitutes “information studies”. Our readings span important scholarly material along with important contributions from journalism. We meet once per week.
